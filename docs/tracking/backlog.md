# UEMCP Backlog

> Tracks future-consideration items that aren't currently dispatched as handoffs and aren't load-bearing enough to live in the D-log. Distinct from `risks-and-decisions.md` (which logs decisions) and from `docs/handoffs/` (active dispatches). Without this file, these items would exist only in orchestrator conversation context and evaporate between sessions.
>
> **Maintenance rule**: when an item here gets dispatched as a handoff or folded into a committed plan, **remove it from this file** — it migrates to a real artifact. This file only holds *currently-not-dispatched* items.

## Tool-surface cleanup

Tools already shipped with known redundancies or deprecation candidates. Typically resolved by yaml edits or one-line handler removals.

### TS-1 — `actors.take_screenshot` ↔ `visual-capture.get_viewport_screenshot` duplication
- **Source**: Agent Workflow Catalog, over-served #1 (2026-04-16)
- **State**: already yaml-flagged; no deprecation committed
- **Fix**: one-line yaml removal or informational-only redirect
- **Trigger**: next tool-surface cleanup pass or Phase 3 scope refresh

### TS-2 — `widgets.add_widget_to_viewport` NO-OP
- **Source**: Agent Workflow Catalog, over-served #2 + D27
- **State**: C++ handler returns "use Blueprint nodes instead"; tool surface is misleading
- **Fix**: remove from yaml OR rename to `get_widget_class_path` with informational description per D27
- **Trigger**: next tool-surface cleanup pass or Phase 3 scope refresh

### TS-3 — `editor-utility.create_asset` scope review
- **Source**: Agent Workflow Catalog, over-served #3
- **State**: no observed catalog demand
- **Fix**: drop from yaml if still undemanded at Phase 3 dispatch
- **Trigger**: Phase 3 plugin scope refresh research

## Enhancements

New capability proposals not yet scoped. Each has a workflow trigger that would justify prioritization.

### EN-1 — `query_asset_registry.size_field` filter (`min_size_bytes` / `max_size_bytes`)
- **Source**: Agent Workflow Catalog Q4; Noah accepted as "worth queuing" (2026-04-16)
- **Scope**: one yaml param addition; parser already tracks `sizeBytes` — no parser work
- **Enables**: "which ProjectA assets > 5 MB?", "audit size-optimization candidates"
- **Cost**: ~15-min enhancement worker
- **Trigger**: next enhancement round or fold into polish pass

### EN-2 — `find_blueprint_nodes_bulk(path_prefix)` corpus-wide variant
- **Source**: Agent 10.5 manual tester Item #2 (2026-04-16)
- **Scope**: new offline tool scanning all BPs under a path_prefix, running the `find_blueprint_nodes` filter per BP, returning aggregated per-BP match counts
- **Enables**: "find all ProjectA BPs that call `ApplyGameplayEffectToTarget`", "which BPs handle `ReceiveAnyDamage`"
- **Cost**: 1-2 agent sessions (bulk-scan pattern new to offline tier)
- **Trigger**: corpus-wide find/grep workflow becomes routine, or bundled with next enhancement round

### EN-3 — Agent-infra parity audit workflow
- **Source**: Workflow Catalog §7a amendment (2026-04-16), Noah Q3 — surfaced as a missed workflow category
- **Scope**: tool(s) comparing CLAUDE.md / plugin config / tool coverage / toolset setup between ProjectA and ProjectB, reporting drift
- **NOT game-content diff** — about agent-infrastructure symmetry
- **Cost**: open-ended; design work needed before scoping
- **Trigger**: agent-config drift between the two projects starts causing workflow confusion, OR ProjectB matures enough that parity auditing becomes routine

### EN-4 — Math/comparison K2Node graduations for S-A skeletal
- **Source**: Agent 11.5 Q-2, D48 — explicitly deferred
- **Candidates**: `UK2Node_PromotableOperator`, `UK2Node_CommutativeAssociativeBinaryOperator`, `UK2Node_EnumEquality`, `UK2Node_Select`, `UK2Node_MultiGate`
- **Scope**: extend `find_blueprint_nodes` skeletal set from 13 to ~18 node classes
- **Cost**: per-node UPROPERTY extraction pattern similar to existing skeletal 13
- **Trigger (D48-defined)**: workflow demand for math-operator introspection in BPs

### EN-5 — Reflection-based lint: yaml params ↔ handler param reads
- **Source**: Audit A (post-Agent-10.5 codebase health) §3 insight 2026-04-19
- **Scope**: automated lint that, for each offline tool's handler case in `executeOfflineTool`, verifies every `params.<X>` read has a matching declaration in the tool's yaml `params:` block. Generalizes D44's structural invariant from a one-time-refactor into a maintained guarantee. Would have caught F-2 + F-3 (Pre-Phase-3 Fixes Worker items) automatically.
- **Implementation sketch**: parse `offline-tools.mjs` via a lightweight JS AST walk; per switch-case, grep for `params.X` accesses; cross-reference against the tool's yaml entry. Lint fails if any read is undeclared. Run as part of test rotation.
- **Cost**: 1-2 agent sessions. Most of the cost is AST walking + handling edge cases (destructuring, alias chains).
- **Trigger**: after the next time a yaml↔handler param drift is caught by manual testing or audit. If F-2/F-3 class issues recur, promote.

## Fixture planting

Test-coverage gaps requiring artificial fixtures in ProjectA/ProjectB.

### FX-1 — TMap BP CDO micro-fixture
- **Source**: Agent 10.5 manual tester Item #1 (2026-04-16)
- **Gap**: no ProjectA BP CDO holds a `TMap<K,V>`; manual §2.1/§2.3 had to skip live-fixture testing. Synthetic unit tests cover both paths.
- **Disposition**: optional; small maintenance burden for marginal value
- **Trigger**: ProjectB naturally introduces TMap usage, OR TMap-parse regression surfaces that synthetic tests missed

## Deferred research triggers

Research questions explicitly deferred with named reopening conditions. Watch-for items.

### DR-1 — Tier S-B pin tracing offline parser
- **Source**: Agent 11.5, D48 — FOLD-INTO-3F verdict
- **Cost**: ~8-13 agent sessions; zero reference coverage in CUE4Parse / UAssetAPI for UEdGraphPin binary serialization
- **Reopening (per D48)**:
  1. 3F sidecar work slips indefinitely AND an agent-automation workflow requires offline pin-trace specifically (not just name-level find, which S-A covers)
  2. Sidecar-missing scenarios fire frequently enough that sidecar-coverage discipline becomes untenable
- **State**: neither trigger present today

### DR-2 — L3A full-fidelity UEdGraph byte parsing
- **Source**: Agent 11, D45 — permanently EDITOR-ONLY
- **State**: locked by D45; 3F sidecar is the canonical offline-read path
- **Reopening**: architectural shift — CUE4Parse ports K2Node readers, OR UE editor-side serialization stabilizes enough to reverse-engineer at reasonable cost
- **State today**: no action expected

### DR-3 — Phase 3 dispatch checkpoint: ship 3F sidecar writer as a standalone early milestone?
- **Source**: Noah 2026-04-19 follow-up on offline BP logic, orchestrator-recommended checkpoint
- **Decision to make at Phase 3 dispatch time**: should the 3F sidecar writer (editor plugin component that emits the BP dump JSON on save) ship as its own milestone BEFORE the rest of Phase 3? This would unlock offline BP pin-trace workflows via the sidecar-mediated path (editor-dependent-to-produce, per D45 soft dependency) earlier than the rest of Phase 3 delivers.
- **Why this matters**: Noah asked whether offline-exact-BP-logic is possible. Pure offline pin parsing is ~8-13 agent sessions (D48 FOLD-INTO-3F verdict). The 3F sidecar gives us the same capability at 4-8× lower cost, with editor-mediated version-correctness. Decoupling the sidecar writer from the full Phase 3 package could move offline BP introspection forward meaningfully sooner.
- **Trigger**: Phase 3 dispatch (post-audit). The Phase 3 scope-refresh research handoff (queued to draft post-audit) must include this as an explicit evaluation point, not bury it in general Phase 3 scoping.
- **Related research deliverables**: Agent 11.5's S-B analysis, Agent 11's L3A EDITOR-ONLY verdict, D45, D48, `docs/specs/blueprints-as-picture-amendment.md` (3F sidecar spec).
- **State today**: awaiting Phase 3 dispatch. When the Phase 3 scope-refresh handoff is written, bake this evaluation into its method — don't let it get folded into generic "Phase 3 scope" discussion where it loses specificity.

## Currently-known-issues not in this file

These items ARE dispatched (handoffs exist) so they're NOT tracked here. Per the maintenance rule above, completed handoffs are removed once they ship — this section only lists in-flight or actively-pending dispatches.

In-flight as of 2026-04-19 (post-wave-4):

- Pre-Phase-3 fixes worker (8 items: F-1 MCP Zod-coerce, F-2/3/4/5 yaml drift, F-6 this cleanup, F-7 TOOLSET_TIPS, F-8 doc nit) → `docs/handoffs/pre-phase3-fixes-worker.md`
- Sidecar design session (parallel docs-only research on 3F sidecar writer scope) → `docs/research/sidecar-design-resolutions-2026-04-19.md`
- Phase 3 scope-refresh research (queued post-audit, not yet dispatched at write time)

When any dispatched handoff completes and residual items surface, consolidate them here if they're not immediately dispatchable. When a handoff fully ships, **remove it from this section** — completed work belongs in git history, not in the backlog index.
